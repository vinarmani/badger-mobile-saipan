        <FAQItem title="What is Bitcoin Cash (BCH)?">
          <T>
            Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system for the
            world. BCH enables permissionless spending for micro transactions,
            everyday spending, large business deals, and everything in between.

        <FAQItem title="What are Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) tokens?">
          <T>
            SLP is a token system built upon the Bitcoin Cash network. SLP
            tokens allow anyone - or business - to create, send, and receive
            their own tokens for whatever they want.
          </T>
          <Spacer small />
          <T>
            SLP tokens enable hundreds of new use-cases on the BCH network. From
            voting systems, reward / loyalty points, ticketing systems, event
            payouts, and many many more.

        <FAQItem title="Why can't I send tokens?">
          <T>
            Receiving tokens is free, but sending tokens requires a bit of
            Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to pay the transaction fee - typically
            ~0.00000400 BCH.
          </T>
          <Spacer small />
          <T>
            Be sure to add a little bit of BCH to your wallet and try again.
          </T>
        </FAQItem>

        <FAQItem title="How private is Badger?">
          <T>
            Badger uses a single address for all transactions. This means
            transactions to and from Badger can be linked together with analysis
            relatively easily.
          </T>
          <Spacer small />
          <T>We will make updates focused on privacy in the future.</T>

        <FAQItem title="Should I store a lot of money in Badger?">
          <T>
            No. You probably shouldn't store a lot of money on any mobile
            wallet.
          </T>
          <Spacer small />
          <T>
            Treat Badger similar to your regular wallet. Keep some BCH and
            tokens in it for spending, but store the rest of your crypto in a
            secure hardware wallet.
